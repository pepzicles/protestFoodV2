		"description": "Egyptians often say that bread is life; most eat this staple multiple times a day, many relying on the cheap bread subsidized by the government. In Staple Security, Jessica Barnes explores the process of sourcing domestic and foreign wheat for the production of bread and its consumption across urban and rural settings. She traces the anxiety that pervades Egyptian society surrounding the possibility that the nation could run out of wheat or that people might not have enough good bread to eat, and the daily efforts to ensure that this does not happen. With rich ethnographic detail, she takes us into the worlds of cultivating wheat, trading grain, and baking, buying, and eating bread. Linking global flows of grain and a national bread subsidy program with everyday household practices, Barnes theorizes the nexus between food and security, drawing attention to staples and the lengths to which people go to secure their consistent availability and quality.

The dishes served included soup made from pine cones, bread made from grass and pancakes made out of tree bark.The “uncounted” refers to people who died from the famine without being recorded, as the Soviet authorities kept the artificially-produced famine top-secret, both inside the country and abroad.

During the war, the watermelon became a symbol of the region’s liberation from Russian occupation. Because of the war, most Ukrainians were unable to taste Kherson watermelons this summer. Kherson watermelons were only marketed in the occupied territory in Ukraine. Watermelons taken from the Kherson region were also exported to Russia. Source: We are Ukraine, 2022",

		"description": "This book highlights the Kazakh famine of 1930-33 as one of the most heinous crimes of the Stanlinist regime- More than 1.5 million people perished, and the crisis transformed a territory the size of continental Europe. Yet, the story of this famine remained largely hidden from view, both in Kazakhstan and in the West. The book brings this largely unknown story to light and explores how this famine alters our understanding of Soviet modernization and nation-making.
