## About 
Protest Food consists of three parts: 

### 1) Protest Mooncake Workshop

This workshop encourages participants to merge personal, cultural, and political expression through food. 

Participants can create and consume mooncakes with personalized protest messages. They get to create their own mooncake stamps using 3D-printed letters, numbers, symbols and designs, and imprint the messages on the stamps on the mooncakes.

You can find all 3D models [here](https://github.com/pepzicles/protestFoodV2/tree/main/3D%20models).

This workshop was heavily inspired by [Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Mooncakes](https://protestfood.com/item.html?id=8), as well as my own heritage.

### 3) [Protest Food Online Archive](https://protestfood.com/)

A hand-coded interactive online archive documenting food’s role in social movements globally and historically. 

You can filter entries by category, scale, date, region, and topic — and even submit your own examples, making it a living, participatory record. 

You can view the archive on desktop and mobile at [protestfood.com](https://protestfood.com/).

You can also download the data of my archive from this [json file](https://github.com/pepzicles/protestFoodV2/blob/main/data.json).
