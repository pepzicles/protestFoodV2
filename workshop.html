        <p class = "aboutPara">As part of my project, I hosted a workshop titled “Make Your Own Protest Mooncakes”, heavily inspired by <a href="https://pepzicles.github.io/protestFoodV2/item.html?id=8" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Mooncakes</a>, as well as my Singaporean-Malaysian-Chinese heritage. <p>

        <p class = "aboutPara">Participants can create and consume mooncakes with personalized protest messages. They will get to create their own mooncake stamps using 3D-printed letters, numbers, symbols and designs, and imprint the messages on the stamps on the mooncakes. </p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">This workshop encourages participants to merge personal, cultural, and political expression through food. I will also be facilitating conversations about food’s political significance, encouraging participants to reflect on its role in their own lives.</p>
