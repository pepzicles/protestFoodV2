                <p class = "aboutPara">PROTEST FOOD aims to demonstrate food’s role in collective movements and care throughout history, around the world.<p>
                <p class = "aboutPara">Food plays a crucial role in self-governing one’s life with others. We see food in everything- from friends and family gathering around a kitchen, to neighborhood gatherings, to festivals and rituals, to community fridges, to political organizing, to hunger strikes, to protests and revolutions.</p>
                <p class = "aboutPara">Food is also a topic of contention because it is necessary for survival. Food is often used as a weapon or control over a population. Moreover, access to food, healthy options, and food education are highly monetized and intersectional with race, gender, and class.</p>
                <p class = "aboutPara">Yet, in response, we have seen many communities reclaiming food traditions and using them to heal, connect, and resist cultural erasures. Food has also historically been a subtle vehicle for political expression, often carrying messages of dissent when direct action is risky or repressed.</p>
                <p class = "aboutPara">You can learn more about PROTEST FOOD <a href = "https://pepzicles.com/protest-food" style="text-decoration: underline;">here.</a></p>
