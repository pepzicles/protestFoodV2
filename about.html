        <p class = "aboutPara">Food plays a crucial role in self-governing one’s life with others. We see food in everything- from the everyday where friends and family gather around a kitchen, to neighborhood gatherings, to festivals and rituals, to mutual-aid community fridges around the city, to grassroots political organizing, to hunger strikes, to protests, uprisings, and revolutions. <p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">At the same time, food has also historically been a subtle vehicle for political expression, often carrying messages of dissent when direct action is risky or repressed.</p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">Food is also a topic of contention because it is necessary for survival. Food is often used as a weapon or control over a population. Centuries of battles over land and sustenance have led to food becoming homogenized into a global commodity and a means of wealth accumulation for an insatiable few.</p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">Moreover, in the capitalist economy that we currently live in, access to food, healthy options, and food education are highly monetized and intersectional with race, gender, and class.</p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">Yet, in response, we have seen many communities reclaiming food traditions and using them to heal, connect, and resist cultural erasures. </p>
        <p class = "aboutPara">PROTEST FOOD aims to brings together these powerful narratives, demonstrating food’s role in collective movements and care throughout history, around the world. </p>
